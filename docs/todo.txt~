We recently made a compiler for infocom games v1-v8 from zil/zif to .z
See /home/wohl/zorkie for docs and refrences to .z
This follow on project is to make a compiler named z2js.  It will
compile .z files to playable javascript.  The javascript should
work in browser or node command line javascript.  z2js should
be able to compile any version z V1-V8, although V7 may not really exist.
Games being played should be able to be saved locally and loaded.
As part of the design allow for saving to the supplying web server as a follow on.

I suggest starting with zork1, planetside and enchanter as they were used extensivly
in the zorkie project and are available in source zil/zilf and .z
